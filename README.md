## Description

Our project will allow users to offer or request freelance services to other users of the service. We intend to target first just the local Iowa State University area as users, with possible further expansion.

 

## How It Will Work

Users will create an account and sign into our website. They can then create an offering. They do this by listing what they will offer (service/product/...), their contact information, and the price of their services, and a location marker of where they're located (for future expansion). Other users can then purchase these products/services. A user can also request a service. They do this by listing what they are requesting (service/product/...), their contact information, and how much they are willing to pay for it. Other users can then respond and fulfill this request.
